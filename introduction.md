# Introduction
*Changes of insect behavior heavily depend on olfaction
*At the very beginning of olfactory sensation, volatile chemicals evoke olfactory receptor (OR)-mediated signal transduction at the dendritic membranes of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs)
*OSNs then sends the signal directly to the brain
*Orco is unique: Insect specific, extremely conserved among insects, 7TM "inverted-GPCR" topology, OR-specific co-receptor, its absense shuts down OSN firing
*Reliable genetic evidence has been accumulated for how Orco functions
*However, its cellular mechanisms for localization and signal transduction are still obscure
*Here we present a technical advance and two sets of biological verifications to help speculate the protein-protein interactions of Orco
