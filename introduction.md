# Introduction
* Changes of insect behavior heavily depend on olfaction
* At the very beginning of olfactory sensation, volatile chemicals evoke olfactory receptor (OR)-mediated signal transduction at the dendritic membranes of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs)
* OSNs then sends the signal directly to the brain, the antennal lobes, where axons meet the dendrites of projection neurons
* Each OSN occupy dedicated glomerulus or glomeruli in the antennal lobe
* For the OSNs to properly sense odors, Orco is necessary
* Orco is unique: Insect specific, extremely conserved among insects, 7TM "inverted-GPCR" topology, OR-specific co-receptor, its absense shuts down OSN firing
* Reliable genetic evidence has been accumulated for how Orco functions
* However, its cellular mechanisms for localization and signal transduction are still obscure
* To explore the unknowns, we performed IP-MS with Orco in adult Drosophila
* Here we present a technical advance and two sets of biological verifications to help speculate the protein-protein interactions of Orco
