### Figure 1: Overview

* Orco and other ORs could not be immunoblotted by working immunohistochemistry antibodies recognizing the native proteins (data not shown)
* Thus we decided to use the N-ternimal EGFP-tagged version of Orco and detect the protein with GFP antibodies

### Figure 2: Tissue homogenization and protein solubilization
[Figure 2 (a)]
* The first step was to concentrate Orco-expressing tissues
* We used home-made sieve to collect antenna-sized tissues from frozen adult flies
* Because Orco is only expressed exclusively in the olfactory organs, this step was critical to increase the concentration of the desired protein in the solution

[Figure 2 (b)]
* Next, the sieved tissues were tested with various commertial detergents in two different temperautre conditions
* When we kept the tissues frozen throughout the homogenization procedure, Orco was very poorly solubilized
* The desired protein tended to be trapped with the tissue debris
* Performing homogenization in room temperature fully liberated trapped Orco from the tissues
* Wax would have hardened with all the hydrophobic molecules in low temperature
* The most dramatic improvement happened with DDM, the best mass-spec compatible detergent

[Figure 2 (c)]
* Other 7TM-proteins with EGFP tags were tested to see if the phenomenon in [Figure 2] can be considered as general

### Figure 3: Immunoprecipitation
[Figure 3 (a)]
* Next, for IP-MS, flies with membrane-tethered GFP expressed in the same cells as EGFP::Orco were generated
* Both lines were made in Orco null background since IP was planned to be performed against the tag

[Figure 3 (b)]
* The expression levels of the comparing lines were not optimized
* ???> However, in the IP products, the tag proteins were captured in similar amounts

[Figure 3 (c)]
* The usual urea elution for mass spec experiments was not efficient
* Alternative acid elution was not efficient either
* Alternative elution by boiling gave the best result
* We assume that the interaction between the tag proteins and the beads is tight 

[Figure 3 (d)]
* Urea elution was not just inefficient but also was very unstable environment to the desired protein species
* So instead of boiling, we decided to perform on-bead digestion

### Table 1: Mass spectrometry and protein identification 
[Table 1]
* Orco IP-MS was successful
* Three separate samples were run: two biological replicates, one of them being a set of technical replicates
* This is the list of proteins chosen to be verified
* Only a few ORs were detected
* Surprisingly, a lot of the high-ranking proteins are mitochondrial 
* Recently, novel roles of mitochondria in mammalian OSNs were published and we think it could be the reason \cite{Fluegge_2012}
* Many cytochrome P450s, previously suggested to degrade pheromones, were also detected \cite{Younus_2014}
