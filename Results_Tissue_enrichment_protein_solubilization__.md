# Tissue enrichment, protein solubilization, and co-immunoprecipitation
The major advancement of our method was achieved by protein solubilization from the native tissues. The dendrite is a compartmentalized portion of a neuron resembling cilia \cite{Satir_2010}, and the protein-protein interactions in such environment cannot be represented by any current heterologous expression systems, especially when the cell’s functionality relies on a key protein which is not conserved in other animals. Concerning this fact, we decided to use native tissues lysates for our protein-protein interaction experiments of Orco.

Applying classic molecular biology tools rarely happened for studying ORs from tissues. Although IRs have been isolated from the olfactory tissues \cite{Ai_2013}, we have developed our own protocol to speed up the procedure (Supplementary Fig. S1). Initially several antibodies against Orco and a few ORs were tested on western blotting, but all tested antibodies failed to stably detect the desired proteins (data not shown). To solve the detection problem, we decided to use the EGFP-tagged version of Orco (See Methods) for the following experiments.

Since Orco is exclusively expressed in the antennae and the maxillary palps \cite{Larsson_2004}, we utilized a homemade sieve to routinely collect antenna-sized small tissues (Supplementary Fig. S1). As a result, Orco was successfully enriched in the tissue lysate (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S2) and this method of tissue collection had been used in all of the following experiments. In our pilot experiments, we explored nine commonly-used laboratory detergents to find the best lysis buffer condition for the sieved tissues (Supplementary Fig. S3). In a previous report \cite{Carraher_2013}, seven out of the nine tested detergents were tested to solubilize Orco from Sf9 cells ***They also solubilized Orco from wheat germ cell-free system but I want to ignore this*** and DDM, SDS, and Zwittergent 3-16  successfully solubilized Orco. However, EGFP-tagged Orco from the native tissues showed very different solubility to the seven detergents (Supplementary Fig. S3). Additionally, we found that Orco solubility was sensitive to the temperature of sample preparation. When tissues were kept at freezing temperature up to the solubilization step, only a few detergents could effectively solubilize Orco (Supplementary Fig. S3). Meanwhile, all tested detergents solubilized Orco to a comparable level when the tissues were homogenized at room temperature (Supplementary Fig. S3). We assume that this happens because the wax covering the outer cuticle hardens if the temperautre is low, somehow trapping the hydrophobic components of cells. It was confirmed that the same temperature-senstivitity applies to other closely related seven-transmembrane proteins (Supplementary Fig. S4). We took the advantage over this improved solubilization behavior of Orco from the native tissues and used n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM), one of the best known mass spectrometry-compatible detergents, for the IP-MS experiment (Fig. 1B).

To perform IP-MS, we prepared a control fly line expressing membrane-tethered (myristoylated) GFP in Orco-positive cells (See Methods). Although the control and the experimental lines showed different expression levels of the tag proteins both in the immunohistochemistry and western blotting (Fig. 2C and 2D), as we were going to verify the MS results with electrophysiology in vivo, the expression levels in flies were not adjusted. An excess of total protein for each sample was provided, and in such environment, IP could stably capture similar amount of the bait proteins (Fig. 2D), which could partially compensate the expression level issue.

We expected that the native bait-prey complexes would somewhat dissociate over the course of tissue lysate preparation and re-assemble during the binding incubation of IP. Our method does not present the exact in vivo protein-protein interactions while it assures the prey proteins provided from the natural environment. All IP experiments were done with DDM-solubilized protein samples.

# Mass spectrometry and protein identification
Proteins from the IP-MS raw data for electrophysiological verification were picked out with high stringency. Primary selection was made with the control-to-experimental iBAQ ratios of proteins, where proteins less than 10 in this value were ignored. Number 10 was decided subjectively considering the differences shown in the immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1C), western blots (Fig. 1D), and the iBAQ value ratio of the tag proteins (Supplementary Table S5). We avoided utilizing iBAQ values beyond this purpose because, as mentioned above, the in vivo expression levels of fly lines were not optimized. The resulting list contained 225 prey proteins after eliminating proteins with MS/MS value 0 (Supplementary Table S5), and we decided to narrow down the range for electrophysiological verification according to the MS/MS value ranks. Although MS/MS values may not reflect the accurate quantification of in vivo interactions, we thought it is useful for setting an arbitrary range. The top 30 proteins selected for the live-animal SSR is shown in Table 1. A few representative interactions from the selected proteins were confirmed by western blotting (Fig. 3).

# Verification of the MS-identified proteins
To verify the in vitro results in vivo, each protein from Table 1 was knocked down in individual flies using Orco-GAL4 and UAS-RNAi, and 12-day-old males and females were used for the live-animal SSR.. Cyt-b ranked at 21 was skipped as it had no publicly available fly line. Eventually we tested the knockdown effects of 29 proteins. We assumed that any effect caused by the disruption of Orco function would be apparent in all OSNs, therefore the changes of the A neuron (expressing Or59b) activities from antennal basiconic 2 (ab2) sensilla were checked with methyl acetate (MA) as a representative measure. Within a 4-second interval (Fig. 3A), changes in spontaneous activities and odor-evoked responses were observed (Fig. 3 and 4). The odorant was applied for 0.5 second and the neuronal activities were recorded for four seconds, starting from two seconds ahead the odorant application (Fig. 3A). Out of the 29 tested RNAi lines, none showed increased odor-evoked responses, eight showed decreased odor-evoked responses (Fig. 3B), two showed decreased spontaneous activities in addition to decreased odor-evoked responses (Fig. 4), and 21 showed no notable changes (Supplementary Fig. S7 and S8). Note that the impact of Rab5-RNAi was so serious that we had to use a different kind of measurement to visualize the raw data (See Methods).
