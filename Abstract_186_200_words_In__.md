In animals, the odor space in the environment is perceived by the olfactory system. At the very beginning of odor perception, odorant receptors (ORs) that recognize airborne chemicals, which in turn promotes olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) firing. A general molecular mechanism of ORs is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, which is well conserved across phyla. Interestingly, apart from the norm, insects express a distinct family of ORs in their OSNs. Insect ORs have shown unexpected characteristics in which they are partially analogous to but rather different from GPCRs. Emerging from this Janus identity, as well as the lack of information on protein-protein interactions, the conclusive nature of the insect OR family is still obscure. To facilitate clearer understanding, we came up with a multidisciplinary method for rapid discoveries of potential binding partners of the insect OR family proteins. The dataset presented here baited Orco to capture proteins from the native tissue lysate, analyzed prey proteins with mass spectrometry, and verified binding with RNAi-electrophysiology in vivo. Our result provides a promising resource for further studies and ensures the possibility for the broad application of the method.
