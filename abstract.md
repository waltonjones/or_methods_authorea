Insects compose the greatest class of animals both in diversity and biomass. Inevitably, insect behavior is an important variable of the ecosystem that should be carefully examined and understood. The most critical factor causing changes of insect behavior is olfaction, the interaction between the animal and airborne chemicals. To capture the manifold signals from the air, insects use their unique molecular machinery utilizing an insect-specific protein, Orco. As a general co-receptor of many olfactory receptors (ORs), Orco is necessary for the proper localization of ORs. However, despite the accumulating genetic evidence of its roles, no direct protein-protein interactions of Orco and other cellular proteins has been shown. Here we provide the putative physical interaction data of Orco and the proteins in the cell with immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry technique. Orco proteins from adult tissues were solubilized in its favorable solution environment
