Insects compose the greatest class of animals both in diversity and biomass. Inevitably, insect behavior is an important variable of the ecosystem that should be carefully examined and understood. The most critical factor causing changes of insect behavior is olfaction, the interaction between the animal and airborne chemicals. To capture the manifold signals from the air, insects use their unique molecular machinery with an insect-specific protein, Orco. As the general co-receptor of the olfactory receptors (ORs), Orco is necessary for the proper localization of ORs. However, despite the accumulating genetic evidence of its roles, no direct protein-protein interactions has been shown. Here we provide a
