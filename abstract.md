# Memo
## First author’s note
* The target journal is Scientific Reports.
* I want to emphasize that this paper is about a “multidisciplinary" method for “rapid" discoveries of novel binding partners. Electrophysiology is used as a tool to verify the IP-MS result because just one RNAi lines have been recorded for each protein candidate. No follow-up IHC images will be included.
* I tried to cite papers that contain at least some in vivo results (for physiology). If the paper is about the topology, in vitro-only papers are cited.
* “Biochemistry” and “molecular biology” are used differently in this manuscript. “Biochemistry” was used for experiments that scrutinized molecules at the amino acid and/or functional group (organic chemistry) level. “Molecular biology/physiology” was used mainly to indicate domain-domain and/or protein–protein interactions.
