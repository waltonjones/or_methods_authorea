# Abstract
Insects compose the largest class of animals both in variety and biomass. Inevitably, insect behavior is an important variable of the ecosystem that should be carefully examined and understood. The most critical factor causing changes of insect behavior is olfaction, the interaction between the animal and airborne chemicals. To capture the manifold signals from the environment, insects use an uncommon molecular machinery with a unique insect-specific protein, Orco. As the general co-receptor of the olfactory receptors, Orco is known to be necessary for proper functioning of OSNs.
