Olfaction is an elaborate sensory processing that animals use to perceive chemical information from the environment. At the beginning of odor perception, odorant receptors (ORs) recognize odorants and in turn induce olfactory sensory neuron firing. A general molecular mechanism of this odor-evoked responses is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, which is well conserved across phyla. Remarkably, insects use a distinct set of ORs likely comprising a new category of chemosensory receptors. The insect OR family consists of seven-transmembrane receptors with intracellular N-terminals that heteromultimerize with an obligate coreceptor, Orco. Unfortunately, the functional mechanisms of insect ORs are only explored limitedly due to technical difficulties. To aid insect OR studies and improve understandings about insect olfaction, we introduce a novel platform especially designed for large-scale screenings of insect OR proteinâ€“protein interactions. We obtained the first insect OR family interactome with Orco using Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS). The resulting list of screening candidates was validated with known binding partners and in vivo functional defects of the Orco-positive neurons. We anticipate the platform and the Orco interactome to contribute a useful material to the insect olfaction research community.
