# Tissue enrichment, protein solubilization, and co-immunoprecipitation
The prime objective of this study was to facilitate the discovery of insect 7TM receptor-binding proteins from their natural cellular environment, especially from their adult olfactory organs. Among ?? 7TM receptors expressed in the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) \cite{}, we picked Orco for this study. To achieve the goal, a widely used biochemistry technique was combined with a functional neurobiology analysis tool, which turned out as a two-step method involving immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and live-animal electrophysiology \cite{}. Rather than sharply refining the biochemistry part, we let the validation of protein-protein interactions be directly checked with the recordings of OSNs functioning in vivo.

The major advancement of this study was achieved by protein solubilization from the native tissues. Insect OSNs seem to form a unique cellular environment where they strictly localize ORs on the dendritic membranes with the aid of the insect-specific protein, Orco, for proper functioning \cite{Larsson_2004} \cite{Benton_2006}. The dendrite is a compartmentalized portion of a neuron resembling cilia \cite{}, and the protein-protein interactions in such environment cannot be represented by any current heterologous expression systems, especially when the cell’s functionality relies on the key protein which is not conserved in other animals. Concerning this fact, instead of adopting cell expression technique, we decided to use the actual tissues where Orco is naturally expressed.

Several antibodies against Orco and a few ORs were tested on western blotting, but all tested antibodies failed to detect the desired proteins (data not shown). To solve the detection problem, we decided to use the EGFP-tagged version of Orco for the following experiments (Supplementary Fig. S1) \cite{Benton_2006}.

Since Orco is exclusively expressed in the antennae and the maxillary palps \cite{Larsson_2004}, we utilized a homemade sieve to routinely collect antenna-sized small tissues. As a result, Orco was successfully enriched in the tissue lysate (Fig. 1a) and this method of tissue collection had been used in all of the following experiments. We tested nine commonly-used laboratory detergents to find the best lysis buffer condition for the sieved tissues. In a previous report \cite{Carraher_2013}, seven out of the nine tested detergents were tested to solubilize Orco from Sf9 cells (They also solubilized Orco from wheat germ cell-free system but I want to ignore this...), and DDM, SDS, and Zwittergent 3-16  successfully solubilized Orco. However, EGFP-tagged Orco from the native tissues showed very different solubility to the seven detergents (Supplementary Fig. S2) and additionally, we found that Orco solubility was sensitive to the temperature of sample preparation. When tissues were kept at freezing temperature up to the solubilization step, only a few detergents could effectively solubilize Orco (Supplementary Fig. S2). Meanwhile, all tested detergents solubilized Orco to a comparable level when the tissues were homogenized at room temperature (Supplementary Fig. S2). We assume that this happens because the wax covering the outer cuticle of the sieved tissues hardens if the temperautre is low,  somehow trapping the hydrophobic components of cells. It was confirmed that the same temperature-senstivitity applies to other closely related seven-transmembrane proteins (Supplementary Fig. S3). We took the advantage over this temperature-sensitive solubilization behavior of Orco from the native tissues and used n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM), one of the best mass spectrometry-compatible detergents, for the IP-MS experiment.

To perform IP-MS, we prepared a control fly line expressing membrane-tethered (myristoylated) GFP in Orco-positive cells (See Methods). Although the control and the experimental lines showed different expression levels of the tag proteins, both in the immunohistochemistry and western blotting (Fig. 2d and 2e), as we were going to verify the MS result with electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry, the expression levels in flies were not further adjusted. An excess of total protein for each sample was provided and in such environment IP could stably capture an equivalent amount of the bait proteins (Fig. 2e), which could have partially compensated the expression level problem. We expected that the native bait-prey complexes would somewhat dissociate over the course of tissue lysate preparation and re-assemble during the binding step of IP. This may not preserve the exact in vivo protein-protein interactions, but it certainly assures the prey proteins from the natural environment. All IP experiments were done with DDM-solubilized protein samples.

# Mass spectrometry and protein identification
(Eugene) Table 1.
A few representative interactions from the selected 29 proteins were confirmed by western blotting (Fig. 2).
Weak or transient interactions may not have been detected in this experiment.

# Verification of the MS-identified proteins
Proteins with 10 or higher experimental-to-control iBAQ ratio was picked out and then ranked by their MS/MS values. We chose to work with the top 30 proteins from this list to check the knock-down effects in vivo, but since Cyt-b ranked at 21 was skipped because it had no publicly available fly line, eventually we tested the effects of RNAi with 29 proteins.

Each protein was knocked down in saperate flies cells using Orco-GAL4 and UAS-RNAi, and 12-day-old males and females were used for the live-animal electrophysiology. We assumed that any effect caused by the disruption of Orco function would be apparent in all OSNs, therefore the changes of the A neuron (expressing Or59b) activities from antennal basiconic 2 (ab2) sensilla were checked with methyl acetate as a representative measure \cite{}. The odorant was applied for 0.5 second and the neuronal activities were recorded for three seconds, starting from one second ahead the odorant application (Fig. 3a). Within the 3-second interval, changes in spontaneous activities and odor-evoked responses were observed (Fig. 3 and 4). Out of the 29 tested RNAi, none showed increased odor-evoked responses, eight showed decreased odor-evoked responses (Fig. 3b), two showed decreased spontaneous activities (Fig. 4a), and 21 showed no notable changes (Supplementary Fig. S4 an S5). We thought it was notable that all flies with the decrease in spontaneous activities showed the decrease of the odor-evoked responses.

A well-examined function of Orco is to help ORs to be properly localized at the dendrites of OSNs by trafficking itself together with ORs to the dendritic membranes \cite{Larsson_2004} \cite{Benton_2006} \cite{Bahk_2016}. Dendritic localization of Orco is critical for the functioning of ORs as well as the OSNs. To check if the decrease in the spontaneous activities and the odor-evoked responses were caused by mislocalization of Orco, antennal tissues of the RNAi flies were stained with a custom-made Orco antibody \cite{Larsson_2004}. Out of two tested flies, ? showed mislocalization and ? showed no obvious change in Orco localization (Fig. 4b).
