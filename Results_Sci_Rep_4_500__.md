# Tissue enrichment, protein solubilization, and co-immunoprecipitation
Antibodies against Orco and several ORs had been tested on western blotting, but all tested antibodies failed to detect the desired protein. To solve the detection problem, we decided to use the EGFP-tagged version of Orco for the following experiments (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Since Orco is exclusively expressed in the antennae and the maxillary palps, we utilized a homemade sieve to routinely collect antenna-sized small tissues. As a result, Orco was successfully enriched in the tissue lysate (Fig. 1a) and this method of tissue collection had been used in all of the following experiments. We tested nine commonly-used laboratory detergents were explored to find the best tissue lysis buffer condition. In a previous report \cite{Carraher_2013}, seven out of the nine detergents were tested to solubilize Orco from Sf9 cells (They also solubilized Orco from wheat germ cell-free system but I want to ignore this...), and only DDM, SDS, and Zwittergent 3-16 were successful, but EGFP-tagged Orco from the native tissues showed very different solubility to the seven detergents. Surprisingly, Orco solubility was sensitive to the temperature of homogenization. When tissues were kept at freezing temperature up to the solubilization step and only a few detergents could effectively solubilize Orco (Supplementary Fig. S2). Unexpectedly, all tested detergents solubilized Orco to a comparable level when the tissues were homogenized at room temperature (Supplementary Fig. S2). We assume that this happens because the wax covering the outer cuticle hardens if the temperautre is low. It was confirmed that the same phenomenon applies to other similar seven-transmembrane proteins (Supplementary Fig. S3). We took the advantage over this temperature-sensitive solubilization behavior of Orco and used n-dodecyl Î²-D-maltoside (DDM), one of the best mass spectrometry-compatible detergents, for the immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis. 

To perform IP-MS, we prepared a control fly line expressing membrane-tethered (myristoylated) GFP in Orco-positive cells (See Methods). Although the control and the experimental lines showed different expression levels of the tag proteins, both in the immunohistochemistry and western blotting (Fig. 2D and 2E), because we were going to verify the MS result with electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry, the in vivo expression levels were not optimized. To minimize the effect of the disparity, an excess of total protein for each sample was provided and in such environment IP could stably capture equivalent amount of the bain proteins (Fig. 2E), which partially compensated the expression level problem. We expect that the native bait-prey complexes would largely dissociate over the course of tissue lysate preparation and re-assemble during the binding step of IP. All IP experiments were done with DDM-solubilized protein samples.

# Mass spectrometry and protein identification
(Eugene) Table 1.
A few representative interactions from the selected 29 proteins were confirmed by western blotting (Fig. 2).

# Verification of the MS-identified proteins
Proteins with 10 or higher experimental-to-control iBAQ ratio was picked out and then ranked by their MS/MS values. We chose to work with the top 29 proteins (Cyt-b ranked at 21 was skipped because it had no publicly available fly line) from the list to check the knock-down effects in vivo.  

Each protein was knocked down in Orco-positive cells, and any changes of neuronal activities from the antennal basiconic 2 (ab2) were checked by live-animal electrophysiology. Odor-evoked activities within a ?-second interval and the spontaneous activities were recorded from 12-days-old male and female. Out of the 29 tested RNAi, none showed increased odor-evoked activities, eight showed decreased odor-evoked activities (Fig. 3A), ? showed changes in the spontaneous activities (Fig. 4A), and 21 showed no changes (Supplementary Fig. ?). 

To check if the decrease in the odor-evoked responses was caused by mislocalization or underexpression of Orco, antennal tissues of the RNAi flies with decreased spontaneous activities were stained with the custom-made Orco antibody. Out of three tested RNAi, ? showed dramatic mislocalization (Fig. 4B), ? showed ? (Fig. 4C), and ? showed no obvious changes compared to the control lines (Supplementary Fig. ?).
