## Fly work
Flies were kept at room temperature on the standard medium in use in Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (Indiana, USA) with additional 1.5 g/L Tegosept. For all EGFP-tagged Orco experiments, w; Orco-GAL4, UAS-EGFP::Orco; orco1; was used. To make this line, UAS-EGFP::Orco \cite{Benton_2006} was mobilized by spontaneous crossing-over events and moved onto the chromosome where Orco-GAL4 \cite{Wang_2003} was present. Afterwards, orco1 \cite{Larsson_2004} was combined with this line. The genotype of myristoylated GFP line (the negative control for IP-MS) was w; Orco-GAL4, UAS-myr::GFP; orco1; where UAS-myr::GFP \cite{Pfeiffer_2010} was mobilized the same way as UAS-EGFP::Orco. For the protein solubilization experiment of other 7TM proteins, w; UAS-EGFP::Or47a; Orco-GAL4; and w; UAS-EGFP::Gr21a; Orco-GAL4; was used. UAS-RNAi flies from Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center are Mpcp (#44508), CG40006 (#34691), Sc2 (#63682), Eaat1 (#43287), Cisd2 (#33749), vir-1 (#58209), SP (#25998), T-cp1 (#32854), Rab5 (#30518), Tom70 (#43966), CG2781 (#50710), CG13850 (#42574), CG4729 (#50568), CG30427 (#58271), CdsA (#28075), and CG6178 (#56033) and the GAL4 heterozygous control flies were crossed to either attP40 or attP2 control lines that are officially provided. For Gale, a mutant line was used (#37739). UAS-RNAi flies from Vienna Drosophila Resource Center (Vienna, Austria) are ND-B22 (#23088), CG1309 (#104669), CG6204 (#31162), AIF (#109615), Dic1 (#103757), alpha-Est10 (#107917), Cyp28a5 (#108709), Cyp6a8 (#100459), Cyp6a23 (#100679), Spn28F (#100958), CG15394 (#109031), and out (#108364), and the GAL4 heterozygous control flies were crossed to either the official KK control line or w1118 (for GD lines). All experimental flies were crossed to w; UAS-Dcr2; Orco-GAL4;. For mt:Cyt-b, no fly line was publicly available thus we skipped the RNAi-SSR.

## Tissue preparation
For the whole-body total protein preparation, 10 males and 10 females (total 20 bodies) were used to generate one sample. For the head total protein preparation, 50 male heads and 50 female heads collected on dry ice (total 100 heads) were used to generate one sample. The sieved-tissue total protein preparation was done as follows. Flies within 20 days after eclosion were collected in 50-mL conical tubes and kept at -80°C. The tube with frozen flies was connected to another fresh 50-mL conical tube using a home-made sieve, which has a sheeth of metal mesh (pore size 180 um^2) fixed in between two hollow lids (Supplementary Fig. S1). The assembled gadget were shaken with a vortexter and any small body parts passing through the mesh were collected into the fresh tube. Sieved tissues were immediately processed to minimize protein degradation after breaking OSNs open at their axons. For experiments involving IP, per sample, 20 mg of the sieved tissues were used, and 15 mg was used for the rest of the experiments. All tissues were homogenized on TissueLyser (Qiagen) at 27 Hz for two minutes in room temperature with three surgical-steel beads (3 mm in diameter) were used for each sample. Thick-wall 1.5-mL tubes were used and tissues were kept on wet ice the whole time if not being weighed or homogenized. We do not recommend keeping tissues below freezing temperature during preparation. All tissues were prepped freshly on the day of total protein preparation.

## Total protein preparation
Immediately after making aliquots of tissues, 300 uL of lysis buffer was added into the homogenized tissues and vortexed for one minute to thoroughly mix them. The raw lysate was centrifuged for five minutes at 10,000 rcf at 10°C to get rid of the cuticular chunks. The first supernatant was moved to a fresh tube and centrifuged the same way once more and the final supernatant was moved to a fresh tube. Lysis buffers were prepared using the dilution buffer suggested for GFP-Trap®_A by ChromoTek (Munich, Germany) with a modification that EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 04693159001) were added instead of the suggested protease inhibitors. To solubilize proteins, Triton X-100 (Bio Basic, TB0198), Tween 20 (Biosesang, T1027), Nonidet P-40 or NP-40 (Bio Basic, NDB0385) were added to 1% v/v and Octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside or OG (Fluka, 75083), n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM; ThermoFisher, 89903), CHAPS (Sigma-Aldrich, C5070), CHAPSO (Calbiochem, 220201), Zwittergent 3-16 (Calbiochem, 693023), Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; USB, UB18220S3) were added to 1% w/v. Pellets (Supplementary Fig. S1) were re-solubilized with 2X SDS buffer (ChromoTek's GFP-Trap®_A protocol recipe) by vortexing. Quantification was done with Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher, 23227). Total proteins were stored at -80°C for a week.

## Western blotting
To detect membrane proteins, tissue lysate was mixed with 2X SDS buffer (ChromoTek's GFP-Trap®_A protocol recipe) and loaded without boiling \cite{Kaur_2009}. To detect soluble proteins, samples were additionally boiled at 95’C for 10 minutes before loading. Western blotting was done as suggested in BioRad Mini-PROTEAN Tetra Cell Instruction Manual and 10% gels were used. Segregated proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore, IPVH00010). Primary antibodies and secondary antibodies were incubated in room temperature for one hour and two hours, respectively. Anti-GFP (ThermoFisher, A-11122) diluted 1:20,000, …, and … were the primary antibodies used. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against either rabbit (EMD Millipore, AP132P) at 1:10,000 or mouse (ThermoFisher, 31430) at 1:5,000 were used. SuperSignal™ West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (ThermoFisher, 34087) and BioRad ChemiDoc XRS+ were used for detection.

## Immunoprecipitation and on-bead digestion - reviewed by Eugene
For all IP experiments, 50 uL of bead slurry (ChromoTek, GFP-Trap®_A) was used and the procedure from bead equilibration was done as suggested by ChromoTek. Equal amounts of total protein (above 5 mg) from the control and experimental lysates were incubated with beads in equal volumes for two hours in room temperature. In IPs for MS, all buffers were made with MS-grade water and chelating agents were excluded. On-bead digestion was performed as described previously \cite{Lee_2010} with the anti-GFP beads-bound proteins.

## Mass spectrometric analysis - reviewed by Eugene
Following on-bead digestion, the tryptic peptides were desalted using Stagetips packed with reversed-phase C18 material (3M, 2215) and concentrated using a vacuum concentrator. Dry samples were acidified by 0.1% formic acid right before mass spectrometric analysis. Sample analyses were performed using an EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Scientific) coupled to Q- Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a home-made nano-electrospray ion source. Peptides were separated on a 15-cm reversed phase analytical column with 75-μm internal diameter packed in-house with 3-μm, 100-Å C18 beads (Agela Technologies) using a 160-min gradient from 9.5% to 36.5% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 350 nL/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode to automatically switch between full-scan MS and tandem MS acquisition. Survey full scan mass spectra were acquired in an Orbitrap (300–1800 m/z) using automated gain control target of 1,000,000 ions and a resolution of 70,000. The top twelve most intense ions from the survey scan were isolated with automated gain control target of 500,000 ions at a resolution of 35,000. The isolated ions were fragmented in the high collision dissociation cell by collisionally-induced dissociation with 27% normalized collisional energy and 2 m/z isolation width. Precursor ion charge state screening was enabled and all singly-charged and unassigned charge states were rejected. The dynamic exclusion list was set with a maximum retention time of 30 sec.

## Data analysis - reviewed by Eugene
The raw data files were searched using MaxQuant (version 1.5.3.8) \cite{Cox_2008} against the Uniprot Drosophila database (v2011_5). The search parameters were Lys- C and tryptic digestion, maximum of two missed cleavages, fixed carboxyamidomethyl modifications of cysteine, variable oxidation of methionine, and variable carbamylation of protein N-termini. Mass tolerances for precursor ions were 4.5 ppm and those for fragment ions were 20 ppm. Additionally, to determine the false discovery rate, a decoy database was constructed by reversing the target database. While no minimum score was specified, the protein and peptide level false discovery rates were fixed at 1% and we required that all proteins reported were identified in both biological replicates by at least one peptide.

## Electrophysiology
SSR from ab2 sensilla were performed as described previously \cite{Benton_2011} with 12-day-old adult flies (except for CG13850, where 11-day-old flies were used). First, three sensilla each from a male and a female (total six) were recorded, and when the initial recordings showed phenotype, six additional sensilla from a new male and a new female were recorded the same way. For Rab5-RNAi recordings, 10 sensilla per fly were poked in three males and three females (total 60) and the number of sensilla with spontaneous activities were counted. Among the sensilla with spontaneous activities, MA-responsive sensilla were recorded. Methyl acetate (MA; Sigma-Aldrich, 45999) was used in 1:100,000 dilution in paraffin oil (PO; Sigma-Aldrich, 76235). Statistics and graph drawing were done in Prism by GraphPad Software (California, USA) and the two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons were applied. One, two, or three asterisks represent P-values less than 0.05, 0.01, or 0.001, respectively.
