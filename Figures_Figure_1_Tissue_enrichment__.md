## Figure 1: Tissue enrichment, protein solubilization (only DDM), and immunoprecipitation
* 1A (WB): Body < heads < sieved tissues, successful protein enrichment
* 1B (WB): EGFP::Orco and myr::GFP solubilization in DDM, sups and pellets, at room temperature
* 1C (IHC): EGFP::Orco and myr::GFP expression in tissues
* 1D (IP-WB): EGFP::Orco and myr::GFP IP products

## Table 1: IP-MS top 30 (ones tested with electrophysiology)

## Figure 2: Immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting (IP-WB of selected proteins from Table 1)

## Figure 3: Changes on the odor-evoked activities upon RNAI of individual proteins (only ones with change)
* 3A (spike images): The recording window of paraffin oil stimulation and odor stimulation
* 3B (graphs): Only positive results (8/29)

## Figure 4: Decreased spontaneous activity upon RNAI of vir-1 and Rab5 (only ones with change)
* 4A (spike images): How vir-1 and Rab5 spontaneous activities look like, compared to the controls and orco1
