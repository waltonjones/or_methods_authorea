Figure 1. Tissue enrichment, protein solubilization, and immunoprecipitation. Western blots against EGFP and GFP tags. (A) Comparison of EGFP::Orco in equal amounts of total protein extracted from different body parts. All samples were solubilized by 4\% SDS. 50 ug of total proteins for each. (B) Solubility of of EGFP::Orco in various laboratory detergents. All samples were solubilized by buffers containing 1\% detergent. Labels on the top: a, Tween 20; b, Triton X-100; c, NP-40; d, OG; e, DDM; f, CHAPS; g, CHAPSO; h, Zwittergent 3-16; i, SDS. 30 ug of total proteins for each. (C) Other EGFP-tagged antennal 7TM proteins detected the same way as EGFP::Orco and myr::GFP. All samples were solubilized by 1\% DDM. 50 ug of total proteins for each. (D) Comparison of IP efficiency. 1\% input, 1\% non-bound, and 5\% IP product. Asterisk: Size shift caused by boiling samples.
