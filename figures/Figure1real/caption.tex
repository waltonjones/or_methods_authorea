Figure 1. Tissue enrichment, protein solubilization, and immunoprecipitation. Western blots against EGFP and GFP tags. (A) Comparison of EGFP::Orco in equal amounts of total protein extracted from different body parts. All samples were solubilized by 4% SDS. 50 ug of total proteins for each. (B) Solubility of of EGFP::Orco in various laboratory detergents. All samples were solubilized by buffers containing 1% detergent. 30 ug of total proteins for each. (C) Other EGFP-tagged antennal 7TM proteins detected the same way as EGFP::Orco and myr::GFP. All samples were solubilized by 1% DDM. 50 ug of total proteins for each. (D) Comparison of IP efficiency. 1% input, 1% non-bound, and 5% IP product.
