### Figure 1: Overview
* Overview diagram of the entire procedure

### Figure 2: Tissue homogenization and protein solubilization
* Orco and other ORs could not be immunoblotted by working immunohistochemistry antibodies recognizing the native proteins (data not shown)
* Thus we decided to use the N-ternimal EGFP-tagged version of Orco and detect the protein with GFP antibodies

[Figure 2 (a)] - tissue concentration >>SDS<<
* The first step was to concentrate Orco-expressing tissues
* We used home-made sieve to collect antenna-sized tissues from frozen adult flies
* Because Orco is only expressed exclusively in the olfactory organs, this step was critical to increase the concentration of the desired protein in the solution

[Figure 2 (b)] - suitable detergents and the temperature of homogenization
* Next, the sieved tissues were tested with various commertial detergents in two different temperautre conditions
* When we kept the tissues frozen throughout the homogenization procedure, Orco was very poorly solubilized
* The desired protein tended to be trapped with the tissue debris
* Performing homogenization in room temperature fully liberated trapped Orco from the tissues
* The most dramatic improvement happened with DDM, the best mass-spec compatible detergent
* We decided to use DDM for IP-MS

[Figure 2 (c)] - OR and GR are also better solubilized with the Orco protocol >>NP40<<
* Other 7TM-proteins with EGFP tags were tested to see if the phenomenon in (b) can be considered as general
* Wax would have hardened with all the hydrophobic molecules in low temperature

### Figure 3: Immunoprecipitation
[Figure 3 (a)] - tissue stainings of the experimental and control flies
* Next, for IP-MS, flies with membrane-tethered GFP expressed in the same cells as EGFP::Orco were generated
* Both lines were made in Orco null background since IP was planned to be performed against the tag

[Figure 3 (b)] - IP results from those the flies
* The expression levels of the comparing lines were not optimized
* ???> However, in the IP products, the tag proteins were captured in similar amounts

[Figure 3 (c)] - conventional elution methods do not work
* The usual urea elution for mass spec experiments was not efficiently eluting the bound proteins
* Alternative acid elution was not efficient either
* Alternative thermal elution by boiling in SDS buffer gave the best result
* We assume that the interaction between the tag proteins and the beads is extremely tight 

[Figure 3 (d)] - elution kinetics
* To overcome the tight interaction between EGFP and the beads, we tried to increase the amount of elution time
* 1 hr seemed to be giving the best result
* Problem 1: We observed the disappearance of EGFP::Orco for longer incubation in urea elution buffer
* We also found that even in -80'C, EGFP::Orco disappears over time in urea elution buffer ((S1))
* It seems like urea does not provide a favorable environment to EGFP::Orco
* Problem 2: Immediate mass spec after 1-h urea elution gave the result with very little amount of Orco protein
* We decided to perform on-bead digestion

### Table 1: Mass spectrometry and protein identification 
[Table 1] - list of proteins chosen to be tested
* Orco IP-MS was successful
* Three separate samples were run: two biological replicates, one of them being a set of technical replicates
* This is the list of proteins chosen to be verified
* The entire list (suppl.)
* Only two abundant ORs were detected
* Surprisingly, a lot of the high-ranking proteins are mitochondrial 
* Recently, novel roles of mitochondria in mammalian OSNs were published and we think it could be the reason \cite{Fluegge_2012}
* Many cytochrome P450s, previously suggested to degrade pheromones, were also detected \cite{Younus_2014}

### Figure 4: Electrophysiology - biological verification 1 
[Figure 4] - proteins that disrupt the function of the OSN, possibly by the loss of protein-Orco interaction
* Show electrophysiology graphs of the genes that showd significant changes

### Figure 5: Immunohistochemistry - biological verification 2 
[Figure 5] - proteins that disrupt the localization of Orco
* Show IHC images with significant changes
