# Tissue enrichment, protein solubilization, and co-immunoprecipitation
Antibodies against Orco and several ORs had been tested on western blotting, but all failed to detect the desired protein. To solve the detection problem, we deicded to use the EGFP-tagged version of Orco for all experiments (See Methods).

Since Orco is exclusively expressed in the antennae and the maxillary palps, we utilized a homemade sieve to routinely collect antenna-sized small tissues. As a result, Orco was successfully enriched in the tissue lysate (Fig. 2A) and this method of tissue collection had been used in all of the following experiments. Next, nine commonly-used laboratory detergents were explored to find the best tissue lysis buffer condition. According to a previous report, only DDM, SDS, and Zwittergent 3-16 among seven overlapping detergents successfully solubilized Orco from Sf9 cells \cite{Carraher_2013}, however, Orco from the native tissues showed different solubility to the seven detergents. Moreover, Orco solubility dramatically changed depending on the homogenization condition. Initially, tissues were kept at freezing temperature up to the solubilization step and only a few detergents could effectively solubilize Orco (Fig. 2B). Unexpectedly, all tested detergents solubilized Orco to a comparable level when the tissues were homogenized at room temperature (Fig. 2B). We assume that this happens because of the hardened wax from the outer cuticle. It was confirmed that the same phenomenon applies to other similar seven-transmembrane proteins. We took the advantage over this finding and used n-dodecyl Î²-D-maltoside (DDM) for immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis. 

To perform IP-MS, we prepared a control line expressing membrane-tethered GFP in Orco-positive cells.
