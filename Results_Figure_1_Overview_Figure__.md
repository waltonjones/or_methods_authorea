# Tissue enrichment, protein solubilization, and co-immunoprecipitation
Antibodies against Orco and several ORs had been tested on western blotting, but all tested antibodies failed to detect the desired protein. To solve the detection problem, we deicded to use the EGFP-tagged version of Orco for all experiments (See Methods).

Since Orco is exclusively expressed in the antennae and the maxillary palps, we utilized a homemade sieve to routinely collect antenna-sized small tissues. As a result, Orco was successfully enriched in the tissue lysate (Fig. 2A) and this method of tissue collection had been used in all of the following experiments. Next, nine commonly-used laboratory detergents were explored to find the best tissue lysis buffer condition. In a previous report \cite{Carraher_2013}, seven out of the nine detergents were tested to solubilize Orco from Sf9 cells, and only DDM, SDS, and Zwittergent 3-16 were successful, but EGFP-tagged Orco from the native tissues showed very different solubility to the seven detergents. Surprisingly, Orco solubility was sensitive to the temperature of homogenization. When tissues were kept at freezing temperature up to the solubilization step and only a few detergents could effectively solubilize Orco (Fig. 2B). Unexpectedly, all tested detergents solubilized Orco to a comparable level when the tissues were homogenized at room temperature (Fig. 2B). We assume that this happens because the wax covering the outer cuticle hardens if the temperautre is low. It was confirmed that the same phenomenon applies to other similar seven-transmembrane proteins (Fig. 2C). We took the advantage over this temperature-sensitive solubilization behavior of Orco and used n-dodecyl Î²-D-maltoside (DDM), one of the best mass spectrometry-compatible detergents, for the immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis. 

To perform IP-MS, we prepared a control fly line expressing membrane-tethered (myristoylated) GFP in Orco-positive cells (See Methods). Although the control and the experimental lines showed different expression levels of the tag proteins, both in the immunohistochemistry and western blotting (Fig. 2D and 2E), because we were going to verify the MS result with electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry, the in vivo expression levels were not optimized. To minimize the difference in the expression levels, an excess of total protein for each sample was provided and IP could stably capture equivalent amount of the bain proteins in this environment (Fig. 2E), which partially compensated the expression level problem. We expect that the native bait-prey complexes would largely dissociate over the course of tissue lysate preparation and re-assemble during the binding step of IP.
