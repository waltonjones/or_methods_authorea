# Introduction
Olfaction is an elaborate chemosensory processing that animals use to perceive the information in the medium. Unlike vision and audition, where a handful sorts of cells are involved in signal discrimination, olfaction necessitates tens and thousands of different cells. Distinct olfactory systems have emerged to benefit diverse lifestyles of animals, where there are overlapping and deviating features between animal groups. The most impressive commonality among well-studied olfactory systems is the G protein-mediated signal transduction of ORs. Since the first discovery in mammals \cite{Buck_1991}, OR genes in other organisms have been screened for seven-transmembrane domain (7TM) protein structure, where vertebrate and nematode OR repertoires were successfully identified and characterized as GPCRs \cite{Nei_2008} \cite{Kaupp_2010}. However, the encounter with the insect OR family did not happen as expected.
