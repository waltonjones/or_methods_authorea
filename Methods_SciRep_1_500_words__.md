For all EGFP-tagged Orco experiments, w; Orco-GAL4, UAS-EGFP::Orco; orco^1; was used. To make this line, UAS-EGFP::Orco\cite{Benton_2006} was mobilized to the chromosome where Orco-GAL4\cite{Wang_2003} was present and orco^1\cite{Larsson_2004} was combined to this line. For the protein solubilization experiment, w; UAS-Or47a; Orco-GAL4; was used. For the IP-MS experiment, w; Orco-GAL4, UAS-myr::GFP; orco^1; was used. UAS-myr::GFP\cite{Pfeiffer_2010} was mobilized the same way as UAS-EGFP::Orco. For the electrophysiology experiment, ... For the immunohistochemistry experiment, ...
