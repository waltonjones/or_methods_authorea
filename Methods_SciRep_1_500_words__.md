For all EGFP-tagged Orco experiments, w; Orco-GAL4, UAS-EGFP::Orco; orco^1; was used. To make this line, UAS-EGFP::Orco\cite{Benton_2006} was mobilized by spontaneous crossing-over events and moved onto the chromosome where Orco-GAL4\cite{Wang_2003} was present. Afterwards, orco^1\cite{Larsson_2004} was combined to this line. For the protein solubilization experiment, w; UAS-Or47a; Orco-GAL4; was used. For the IP-MS experiment, w; Orco-GAL4, UAS-myr::GFP; orco^1; was used. UAS-myr::GFP\cite{Pfeiffer_2010} was mobilized the same way as UAS-EGFP::Orco. For the electrophysiology experiment, ... For the immunohistochemistry experiment, ...

## Immunoblotting
Total proteins were mixed with 6X Laemmli buffer and, without boiling, loaded to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel was used as suggested by BioRad Mini-PROTEAN Tetra Cell Instruction Manual. Segregated proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane (Millipore IPVH00010) in the standard Tris-glycine buffer. To detect EGFP on PVDF membranes, anti-GFP (ThermoFisher A-11122) was used, diluted to 20,000X in the standard TBST buffer with 5% skim milk.
